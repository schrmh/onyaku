Onyaku can transliterate between japanese writing systems (supports kana) and latin letters (romaji).  
  
  
This is meant as a replacement for those three tools:  
- hira (https://github.com/robpike/hira)  
- kata (https://github.com/robpike/kata)  
- kana (https://github.com/robpike/kana)  
Because those have some design flaws (e.g. puuru is not converted to プール and reverse).  
  
Onyaku also strives to become a more complete solution.
